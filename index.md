# Hello and Welcome!

I'm starting this blog to document my journey deep into Zero-Knowledge Proofs, cryptography, and Web3 development. I'm focusing on practical insights, data-supported analysis, and the latest news in the trustless space.

ZKP-Powered Web Protocols for Data Delivery

Imagine a world where instead of fetching a webpage (HTML/JS) and then executing potentially untrusted JavaScript to verify data, you receive a compact ZKP that proves the integrity and validity of the data you‚Äôre requesting, without needing to re-fetch the raw data itself or trust the server to compute correctly.

In this world data isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúsent‚Äù and received; it‚Äôs cryptographically proven to be correct, legitimate, and derived from a specific source, right at the protocol level.

Now how does this method mathematically win on TPS/Data Delivery Speed. This method enables a massive reduction in data transfer through latency and bandwidth savings.¬†

The current web is written predominately with HTML, JavaScript and the likes thereof requires many verifications for example:¬† ‚ÄúIs this user authorized?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs this transaction valid?‚Äù To anser these queries it is required to fetch a significant amount of data (HTML, JS, CSS, images, API responses), and then perform computations locally or rely on server-side computations.

In a blockchain, or zero knowledge proof web instead of sending the full data and expecting the client to verify it or the server to send a trusted result, the server or designated prover computes a proof that a certain statement about the data is true. This proof is extremely small (a few kilobytes) compared to the raw data it verifies.

This results in time savings, meaning that instead of downloading megabytes or gigabytes, you download kilobytes. This radically cuts down latency (time-to-first-byte) and bandwidth especially in high-latency environments such as satellite internet, or even long distances.

We are talking about instantaneous client-side verification. In the current web, JavaScript execution can be slow, resource-intensive, and introduces trust issues. Programmers often ask is the JavaScript itself malicious or buggy?

In a zero-knowledge proof web or blockchain web, verifying a zero-knowledge proof(ZKP) is computationally very fast and constant or near constant-time regardless of the complexity of the statement being proven. The client simply checks the proof.¬†

This results in time saved because it eliminates the need for extensive client-side computation or round-trips to the server for verification. Proof verification is orders of magnitude faster than re-executing a complex calculation or re-downloading large datasets.

The new web will eliminate redundant trust cycles. In the current web, everytime a client interacts with a new server or API trust or perform checks are re-established. IN a zero-knowledge proof web, once a valid proof for a piece of data or a state transition is established, that proof becomes a mathematical guarantee. It is not required to re-verify the underlying computation.
The application of a zero-knowledge proof web results in time savings through simplified application logic, reducing development cycles and removing points of failure.

Another advantage of a zero-knowledge proof web is enhanced privacy by default. In the current web to verify something, a client is often required to reveal what is being verified. For example, for a client to prove they are over 18, they might be required to reveal their ID. In the zero-knowledge proof web, a statement can be proven true, without revealing the underlying data. It could be proven that a client is over 18 without revealing the birth date or name. While this function of a zero-knowledge proof does not directly improve speed, it reduces friction and improves client experience, in itself an indirect efficiency gain.

A conceptual example of blockchain, or Ethereum, or zero-knowledge proof web, also known as Web3 follows: It is important to note before reading the example that the mechanics of this example apply to multiple data types.¬†

In the current web, a user clicks a link to view a financial report. The browser downloads HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.¬† The JavaScript fetches data from an API, renders charts and assumes the data is correct as provided by the server.

In the zero-knowledge proof web, the user clicks a link. Then, the web client receives a small zero-knowledge proof that proves a specific financial report was correctly generated from auditable raw data, and that the report conforms to certain criteria, such as the sum of all transactions equals the financial balance. The client quickly verifies this proof. If the user wants to drill, new small proofs are generated and verified for the specific data subsets requested. The full report is not provided unless explicitly requested, and even then, its integrity is pre-proven.

The challenges of developing Web3 are objectifiable and quantifiable. Proof generation time is one such example as generating zero-knowledge proofs can be computationally expensive on the provider side.¬† This is an active area of research, developing recursive zero-knowledge proofs and hardware acceleration for proving.¬†¬†

Another massive, yet achievable challenge is the development of, or rather implementation of universal circuits and protocols. Designing generic zero-knowledge proof friendly web protocols that can replace HTML/JS functionality is an achievable goal.

Perhaps, most promising to young developers is the fact that the ecosystem of tools and developer familiarity for Web3 is still nascent compared to Web 2.0.

In conclusion, to quote developer Vitalik Buterin, ‚ÄúLow-risk DeFI can be for Ethereum (implied blockchain, zero-knowledge proof web, Web3) what search was for Google.‚Äù Let‚Äôs build it.
