## The Benefits of ZKPs
* **Speed:** ZKPs reduce verification time with proofs as small as 200-300 bytes [Halborn](https://www.halborn.com/...), cutting latency in high-latency networks.
* **Privacy:** Verify data (e.g., age > 18) without revealing details, enhancing user trust.
* **Trust Elimination:** No third party needed, as proofs are mathematically guaranteed.
> As Buterin said, "zk-SNARKs are essentially a scalability solution for blockchain."
## Real-World Example
In a ZKP web, a financial report’s integrity is proven with a kilobyte proof, not megabytes of data—faster and secure.
