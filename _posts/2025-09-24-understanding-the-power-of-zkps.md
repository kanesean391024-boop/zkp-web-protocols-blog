## The Benefits of ZKPs
* **Speed:** ZKPs can significantly reduce transaction verification time, with proofs as small as 200-300 bytes [Halborn].
* **Privacy:** They allow for data verification without revealing the underlying information, enhancing user trust.
* **Trust Elimination:** ZKPs remove the need for a trusted third party, streamlining processes.
> As Buterin eloquently put it, "zk-SNARKs are essentially a scalability solution for blockchain."
## Next Steps
Exploring how ZKPs can be integrated into Web3 protocols—stay tuned for more!
